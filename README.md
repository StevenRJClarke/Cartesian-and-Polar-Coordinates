## About

An educational application allows you to draw a point on a pair of axes and to see the coordinates of that point in both Cartesian and Polar coordinates.

The user can also enter a point in Cartesian coordinates, to convert it to Polar coordinates and vice versa. The angular coordinate can be given in degrees or radians.
